# INT4xINT4 MoE kernel (RDNA4 / gfx1201) — measured results

Native int4 WMMA (`wmma_i32_16x16x16_iu4_w32_gfx12`), hiprtc-compiled,
ctypes-launched, signed int4 exact via neg=(1,1). Grouped MoE = 8
per-expert launches of the proven LDS-staged dense kernel on host-sorted,
16-padded token segments. Verified max|err| = 0.0 vs numpy dequant at
T=256/4096/16384.

| T tokens | int4 grouped MoE | TFLOPS | int8 _int_mm | fp32 eager | vs fp32 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 256  | 0.270 ms | 2.98  (launch-bound) | 20.4  | 6.7   | 0.44x |
| 4096 | 0.331 ms | 38.87 | 103.7 | 11.8  | **3.30x** |
| 16384| 1.027 ms | 50.19 | 152.3 | 16.3  | **3.09x** |

- 38.9 TFLOPS @ T=4096 = ~95% of the 40.8 TFLOPS community-measured
  int4-WMMA ceiling for this silicon (R9700 guide; RX 9070 same die).
- vs int8 rocBLAS: 0.33-0.37x compute-throughput — expected: int4's win
  on RDNA4 is bandwidth/VRAM (4x weight compression), not MMA rate
  (no int4 WMMA advantage over int8 in ALU throughput; ISA-confirmed).
- Launch overhead: 8 launches ~ 0.24ms; amortized at T>=4096.
